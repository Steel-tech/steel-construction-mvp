```

## Key APIs & Services

### Authentication
- `AuthContext.tsx` - Auth provider with login/signup/logout
- Protected routes with role checking
- JWT token management

### Piece Mark Service
```typescript
pieceMarkService.ts:
- getByProject(projectId)
- create(pieceMark)
- update(id, updates)
- updateStatus(id, status)
- bulkUpdateStatus(ids, status)
- search(projectId, term)
- getStatistics(projectId)
```

### Field Operations
- Delivery receiving and verification
- Location tracking with visual indicators
- Crew assignment by shift (day/night/weekend)
- Activity logging

## Database Tables

### Core Tables
- `profiles` - User profiles with roles
- `projects` - Construction projects
- `piece_marks` - Steel piece tracking
- `work_orders` - Task management

### Field Tables
- `deliveries` - Shipment tracking
- `delivery_items` - Individual pieces in deliveries
- `crew_assignments` - Daily crew scheduling
- `field_activities` - Activity audit log

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Role-based policies
- Automatic timestamps with triggers

## Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly interfaces (44px min tap targets)
- Responsive grids that adapt to screen size
- Sticky navigation headers
- Swipeable components
- Optimized for phones and tablets

## Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Build for production
cd frontend && npm run build

# Run type checking
cd frontend && tsc --noEmit

# Start Supabase locally
supabase start

# Apply database migrations
supabase db push
```

## Environment Variables
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for route components
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large datasets
- Optimized bundle splitting with Vite
- Image lazy loading for photos

## Security Measures
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS enforcement
- JWT authentication
- Environment variable protection
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries

## Testing Strategy
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- E2E testing with Playwright
- Database testing with Supabase local
- Mobile testing on actual devices

## Deployment
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
- Database: Supabase Cloud
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Environments: Dev â†’ Staging â†’ Production

## Next Priority Tasks
1. **QR Code Integration**
   - Generate QR codes for each piece mark
   - Mobile scanner using device camera
   - Quick status updates via scanning

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Supabase subscriptions for live changes
   - Status updates appear instantly
   - Multi-user collaboration

3. **Photo Documentation**
   - Progress photo uploads
   - Image compression
   - Gallery views per piece/project

4. **Production Scheduling**
   - Shop capacity planning
   - Gantt chart visualization
   - Resource allocation

5. **Quality Control**
   - Digital checklists
   - Inspector sign-offs
   - Non-conformance reports

## Common Workflows

### Shop Workflow
1. Receive work order
2. Scan/select piece marks
3. Update status to "Fabricating"
4. Complete quality checks
5. Mark as "Completed"
6. Prepare for shipping

### Field Workflow
1. Receive delivery
2. Scan pieces on arrival
3. Update locations
4. Assign to crews
5. Track installation
6. Document with photos

## API Endpoints (Supabase)
All API calls go through Supabase client:
- Auth: `supabase.auth.*`
- Database: `supabase.from('table').*`
- Storage: `supabase.storage.*`
- Realtime: `supabase.channel('name').*`

## Known Issues
- Deprecation warning for @supabase/auth-helpers-react
- Need to migrate to @supabase/ssr package
- Some npm audit vulnerabilities (non-critical)
