## ü™ù Auto-Commit Hook

The auto-commit hook automatically commits successful code changes to Git.

### Features
- ‚úÖ Runs TypeScript and ESLint checks before committing
- ‚úÖ Generates conventional commit messages
- ‚úÖ Excludes sensitive files (.env, logs)
- ‚úÖ Groups related changes
- ‚úÖ Configurable via `hooks/config.json`

### Configuration
Edit `.claude-code/hooks/config.json` to customize:
- Commit frequency
- File patterns to include/exclude
- Pre-commit checks
- Push to remote (disabled by default)

### Manual Execution
```bash
./.claude-code/hooks/auto-commit.sh
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Using Agents in Claude Code

1. **For piece mark operations:**
   ```
   "Use steel-tracker to update piece mark B-101 status to erected"
   ```

2. **For database work:**
   ```
   "Use supabase-ops to create real-time subscription for production updates"
   ```

3. **For mobile features:**
   ```
   "Use field-mobile to add offline support for field workers"
   ```

4. **For testing:**
   ```
   "Use test-gen to create tests for PieceMarkCard component"
   ```

### Combining Multiple Agents

For complex tasks, combine agents:
```
"Use steel-tracker and supabase-ops to implement piece mark tracking with real-time updates"
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Agents

1. Create a new JSON file in `.claude-code/agents/`
2. Follow the template structure:
```json
{
  "name": "agent-name",
  "description": "What this agent does",
  "triggers": ["keywords", "that", "activate"],
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit"],
    "actions": ["What it can do"]
  },
  "prompt_template": "Specialized instructions",
  "examples": [],
  "best_practices": []
}
```

### Modifying Hooks

Edit `.claude-code/hooks/config.json` to change hook behavior:
- Enable/disable hooks
- Adjust timing and triggers
- Configure pre-commit checks
- Set commit message format

## üìä Agent Performance Tips

1. **Be specific with triggers** - Use exact agent names for better accuracy
2. **Chain agents for complex tasks** - Combine specialists for best results
3. **Use test-gen frequently** - Your app needs tests!
4. **Enable auto-commit** - Never lose work again

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Auto-commit not working?
- Check TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Verify ESLint: `npx eslint src`
- Check file permissions: `chmod +x .claude-code/hooks/auto-commit.sh`

### Agent not triggering?
- Use exact trigger words from agent configuration
- Be explicit: "Use [agent-name] to..."

## üìö Best Practices

1. **Always use agents for their specialty** - Don't use generic commands when an agent exists
2. **Test after major changes** - Use test-gen to maintain quality
3. **Security first** - Run security-guard regularly
4. **Mobile optimization** - Use field-mobile for all field worker features
5. **Keep commits atomic** - Let auto-commit handle grouping
